Some parts of the code were modified to protect the encoding of the variables in the studies and the sample IDs of the samples (specifically in the pre-processing and EDA scripts), since these cohorts are not publicly available data. When these modifications are present, a commented note is indicated. Please also note that the paths used in the analyses are relative.
